This folder contains the files needed to create the "moving" lower boundary.


11/12/12 btf:
The *.txt files are lower boundary conditions for t,u,v,z from the Oxford
Venus GCM (Chris Lee at Cal Tech). The IDL procedure mknc_lbc reads the
ascii data for each field and creates a netcdf file for all 4 fields,
which can be imported to the vtgcm.

11/20/12 btf:
Received 4 new ascii files from Steve via Amanda with lbc for t,u,v,z at 
10 zp levels -16 to -11.5 by 0.5. Removed pipes "|" and commas "," from 
the ascii files to make them easier to read with IDL. Used the following 
vi commands for this purpose:

:1,$s/|//g         # globally replace "|" with null
:1,$s/,/ /g        # globally replace "," with a single space

Modified mknc_lbc.pro to create the netcdf file oxvgcm_lbc.nc with added 
lev dimension and coordinate for the 10 levels. Now the vtgcm lbc can
be nudged at each level, rather than only from the lower boundary.
